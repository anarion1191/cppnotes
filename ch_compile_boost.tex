\chapter{Building the Boost Library}

In order to build the Boost library, the tool \textbf{b2} should be used. Assuming \textbf{clang++} is in the path, in order to build Boost using Clang++ and libc++:

\begin{lstlisting}
./b2 toolset=clang cxxflags="-stdlib=libc++ -std=c++14" linkflags="-stdlib=libc++ -std=c++14" -j 8
\end{lstlisting}

At the moment (Boost version 1.66.0), compilation cannot be done with the "-std=c++17" flag, because the \textit{auto_ptr} class has been removed but parts of Boost are still using it. \textit{auto_ptr} had been deprecated since C++11 and finally removed in C++17.

Compiling boost took the following time in the first round:
real	116m2.628s
user	474m24.432s
sys	90m33.540s

In total, there were 54 failed targets due to missing pyconfig.h header, which is due to not having python3.5-dev installed.

After installing the needed package, and re-running the build script, it took the following times:
real	7m17.312s
user	29m13.704s
sys	5m40.344s
