\chapter{Compiling a Project With Boost::Beast Dependency}

Assuming the Boost library has been installed such that all of the necessary library and include files are in PATH, the following CMake file can be used:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=CMake]
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)
project(beast_test)

set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++14 -stdlib=libc++")
set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} -lc -lc++ -lc++abi -lpthread")

set(INCLUDES "")
include_directories("${INCLUDES}")

add_executable(beast_test "src/main.cpp")
target_link_libraries(beast_test "libboost_system.so")
\end{lstlisting}
