\chapter{Increment / Decrement Operator}
I have always been confused by the way increment/decrement operators work. I am familiar with what they do: to increment or decrement values. What I never quite understood was the difference between post and pre-increment or decrement.
To illustrate this important yet somehow hidden point, lets evaluate an example code:

\begin{lstlisting}
int i = 0;
if(i++ == 1) {
	std::cout << "i++ is equal to 1" << std::endl;
}
//here, the value of i is 1 for sure
if(++i == 2) {
	std::cout << "++i is equal to 2" << std::endl;
}
\end{lstlisting}
